							<h3>Thoughts..</h3>
							<p>During the last year of university, I was given the opportunity to engage in the field of Deep Learning. So, with the guidance and advice of four people, two of whom are my  teachers and two of whom are good friends of mine, i was able to handle the following thesis. I thank them, and I hope they are always happy!</p>

					<h4>More about this project.</h4>

				<p>In the field of Machine Learning, the need to understand the operation of deep neural networks is becoming more and more important.
It is well established that the focus of researchers' attention on output as well as on the dataset used in neural networks training makes it the primary strategy for understanding the operation of them. This work aims to determine how this focus can improve the knowledge of how deep neural networks operate. Specifically, emphasis is placed on the architectures of two well known and widely used neural networks, VGG16 and ResNet50. In this context, the focus of attention is defined by the creation of a dynamic dataset for the training of the two networks, but also by the way they pay attention to the classification process. 
To test whether the hypothesis that neural networks can be understood macroscopically, a programming tool has been created that has the ability to dynamically export satellite image datasets from the OpenStreetMap database. Also, heatmaps were used to explain the networks trained with these datasets as well as a metric was created which aims at a deeper investigation of the neural classifications. One of the main conclusions of the results is the correlations that are created during the classifications in relation to the characteristics of the environment and whether emphasis is placed on them when choosing a classifier to solve specific problems. The results of this work indicate that research, evolution and the selection of a deep neural network to solve modern problems are well-connected concepts with the conclusion that are based on both the way of training the neural and the explanation of the output extraction.</p>
